Given a text document, identify all entities of the specified types and the direct relationships between them.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each entity, extract:
- entity_name: Name of the entity (Capitalized if English).
- entity_type: One of the following: [{entity_types}]
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>)

2. Identify pairs of entities from step 1 that are clearly related. For each pair, extract:
- source_entity: name of the source entity.
- target_entity: name of the target entity.
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>)

3. Return output as a list of entities and relationships. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying both answer-type and low-level keywords in the user's query.

---Goal---

Given the query, list both answer-type and low-level keywords.
answer_type_keywords focus on the type of the answer to the certain query, while low-level keywords focus on specific entities, details, or concrete terms.
The answer_type_keywords must be selected from Answer type pool.
This pool is in the form of a dictionary, where the key represents the Type you should choose from and the value represents the example samples.

---Instructions---

- Output the keywords in JSON format.
- The JSON should have three keys:
  - "answer_type_keywords" for the types of the answer. In this list, the types with the highest likelihood should be placed at the forefront. No more than 3.
  - "entities_from_query" for specific entities or details. It must be extracted from the query.
